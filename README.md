# Software Installation: Python 3.11 and MNE
Python installation depends on your OS (operating system). As there's quite a bit of shell language involved in the set-up, here I also introduce two alternatives:
- A user-friendly Python and R distribution and package manager, Anaconda. 
- A web-based alternative, _Google Colab_, which should be sufficient for tye purposes of incorporating Python into this course. That being said,trying out the installation is still strongly recommended.

Sections:
- [Windows](#windows)
- [MacOS](#macos)
- [Anaconda](#anaconda)
- [Google Colab](#google-colab)

## Windows
### Check for installed Pythons
In the Windows start menu search bar, type `Python` to see which versions you have installed. If it's already 3.11, skip to section [Python packages via PIP](#python-packages-via-pip); if not, read on to install Python 3.11

### Python 3.11 official installer
Go the the [official Python website](https://www.python.org/downloads/release/python-3115/). Select "Windows installer 64-bit" (if an error occurs and the installation fails, your devic is on a 32-bit processor, so switch to "Windows installer 32-bit"). After the installer file has been downloaded, double-click on the file to run it. In the pop out window, check off ‚òëÔ∏è "Install launcher for all users (recommended)" and ‚òëÔ∏è "Add Python 3.11 to PATH", then click "Install Now".

Open your PowerShell, type
```
py --list
```
to show all the Python versions you have installed (and have been added to PATH). You should at least see 3.11.
- üí° To open PowerShell, type "powershell" in the Windows start menu search bar and click on the PowerShell icon; if you're on Windows 11, press the Windows key and X.

### Python packages via PIP
In the PowerShell, type
```
py -3.11 -m pip list
```
to see all the packages installed by PIP. If your Python 3.11 has just been installed, you'll only see `pip` itself and `setuptools`. In the following steps, we'll install a package called `virtualenv` to create a virtual environment:
```
py -3.11 -m pip install virtualenv
```
After installation, create a new folder called `erpclass`, go to that folder, and create a virtual environment named `venv`. Execute the commands below one line at a time:
```
mkdir erpclass; cd erpclass
py -3.11 -m virtualenv venv
venv\Scripts\activate
pip install jupyterlab mne pandas pingouin openpyxl flake8
```
- **[MNE](https://mne.tools/stable/index.html) is the Python package for reading, processing, analyzing, and plotting EEG/MEG data.**
- [Pandas](https://pandas.pydata.org/docs/) is a powerful library for data analysis amd manipulations in the form of `pandas.DataFrame`
- [Pingouin](https://pingouin-stats.org/build/html/index.html) is for for statistical analyses in Python (I find it more convenient tyan Statsmodels, which comes installed as a dependency with MNE.
- [Openpyxl](https://openpyxl.readthedocs.io/en/stable/) is needed in order for Python to read from and qrite to Excel files.
    + Side note: Excel now accepts (or is about to accept) Python syntax and functions üòç
- [Flak8](https://flake8.pycqa.org/en/latest/) is basically Grammerly for Python.
- ‚ö†Ô∏è In the third line, if you encounter an error related to security policies, open a new PowerShell and **run as the administrator**. Type
```
Set-ExecutionPolicy Unrestricted
```
then type
```
cd C:\Users\<your_user_name>\erpclass; venv\Scripts\activate
```
(change `<your_user_name>` to your actual device user name)
to see if the error gets resolved. If so, proceed to the fourth line
```
pip install jupyterlab mne pandas pingouin openpyxl flake8
```
- ‚ö†Ô∏è In the fourth line, if `pip` doesn't work, perhaps try `py -m pip`.

After it's done, type `pip list` (or `py -m pip list`) again. You should now see a long list of packages installed.

### Opening Jupyter Lab
No we're ready to open your Jupyter Lab! Type
```
jupyter-lab
```
which will automatically open a browser tab (if it doesn't, copy and paste any one of the URLs, e.g., `http:/localhost:blahblahblah` into your browser search bar), and voila! There's your Jupyter Lab! Note also that you do not need the internet to run Jupyter; localhost refers to your device.¬†

Last step, open a Jupyter notebook and paste the following lines into the first cell, then hit Run:
```
import mne
import numpy as np
from platform import python_version
python_version()
```
There should be no errors, and 3.11.5 will be the output.

### Deactivating virtual environments
To deactivate a virtual environment, simply type
```
deactivate
```

## MacOS
### Pre-installed Python
Since most macOS computers come with Python pre-installed (please do not modify your mac's pre-installed Python as it would mess with your system), it's always a good practice to check which Python version you have on your device. Go to your terminal and type `python --version` which probably isn't 3.11.5. The steps below will install the latest Python release and a virtual environment for better package version/dependency management.
- üí° To open the mac terminal, click on the Launchpad icon in the Dock, type `Terminal` in the search field, then click Terminal.
- üí° Apple installs Python in `usr/bin/`, so don't touch anything related to Python in that directory!!!

### Install Homebrew
In the terminal, type
```
brew help
```
to see if Homebrew is installed on your mac. If an error occurs, it is not installed. Type the following command to install Homebrew:
```
/bin/bash -c "$(curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Homebrew/install/HEAD/install.sh)"
```
After installation, type
```
brew doctor
```
to check that everything's okay.
- üí° For an alternative way to install Python with less terminal code involved, please refer to [this page](https://github.com/NTU-BLPLab/ERP_2023Fall/blob/installation/Appendix_A.md).

### Install Xcode Command Line Tools
Check if they're installed:
```
xcode-select --version
```
If they are, you'll get the corresponding version in your terminal output; if not, run
```
xcode-select --install
```
which will pop out a window asking you to install them. Click Install, and wait. You will then see a message display
> The software was installed.

Click Done, and type 
```
xcode-select -p
```
in the terminal, which should output
> /Library/Developer/CommandLineTools

### Install `pyenv` via Homebrew 

After Homebrew has been installed, run the following lines **one line at a time** in the terminal to install Python 3.11.5 and the packages we'll be using in class, along with several others I find useful for data analysis:
```
brew update && brew upgrade
brew install pyenv
```

After installation, run
```
pyenv init
```
<img src="https://github.com/NTU-BLPLab/ERP_2023Fall/blob/installation/screenshots/screenshot1.png" alt="pyenv init" width=400>

and look at the terminal output carefully; follow the instruction there, i.e.,¬† copy and paste the listed lines to your corresponding files, which in my case are `~/.bashrc` and `~/.profile` as I'm running Ubuntu in Windows Subsystem for Linux. Remember to save, then _source_ the files or _close and restart_ your terminal for the changes to take effect. 
- üí° If you've never modified such files and are lost at this step, feel free to screenshot what `pyenv init` outputs and [email me](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1JBO6eFAZ6MM8P9p1YiCILFfPHe5p0GV_/edit?usp=sharing&ouid=103533581234587701878&rtpof=true&sd=true) the picture.

## Python via `pyenv`
Now install Python 3.11.5 using pyenv (this may take a while):
```
pyenv install 3.11.5
```

Set Python to the newly installed version:
```
pyenv global 3.11.5
```

Type
```
which python
```
which should output something like 
> blahblahblah/.pyenv/shims/python

And typing
```
python --version
```
should get you the desired 3.11.5

### Python packages via PIP
Now type
```
pip3 list
```
to see the packages installed by PIP, which in this case are probably just `pip` itself and `setuptools`. We want to install a package called `virtualenv` to create a virtual environment as mentioned in the beginning, so run
```
pip3 install virtualenv
```

After installation, create a new folder called `erpclass`, go to that folder, and create a virtual environment named `venv`. Execute the commands below one line at a time:
```
mkdir erpclass; cd erpclass
virtualenv venv
source venv/bin/activate
pip3 install jupyterlab mne pandas pingouin openpyxl flake8
```
- **[MNE](https://mne.tools/stable/index.html) is the Python package for reading, processing, analyzing, and plotting EEG/MEG data.**
- [Pandas](https://pandas.pydata.org/docs/) is a powerful library for data analysis amd manipulations in the form of `pandas.DataFrame`
- [Pingouin](https://pingouin-stats.org/build/html/index.html) is for for statistical analyses in Python (I find it more convenient tyan Statsmodels, which comes installed as a dependency with MNE.

- [Flak8](https://flake8.pycqa.org/en/latest/) is basically Grammerly for Python.

After it's done, type `pip3 list` again. You should now see a long list of packages installed.

### Opening Jupyter Lab
No we're ready to open your Jupyter Lab! Type
```
jupyter lab
```
which will automatically open a browser tab (if it doesn't, copy and paste any one of the URLs, e.g., `http:/localhost:blahblahblah` into your browser search bar), and voila! There's your Jupyter Lab! Note also that you do not need the internet to run Jupyter; localhost refers to your device.¬†

Last step, open a Jupyter notebook and paste the following lines into the first cell, then hit Run:
```
import mne
import numpy as np
from platform import python_version
python_version()
```
There should be no errors, and 3.11.5 will be the output.

### Deactivating virtual environments
To deactivate a virtual environment, simply type
```
deactivate
```
in the terminal. In addition, if you now type
```
pip3 list
```
after `venv` has been deactivated, you won't see any of the packages we just installed after `virtualenv`.

## Anaconda

## Google Colab
Google Colab provides free access to IPython notebooks, which can be saved and shared as do any other Google documents. To open a new Colab notebook, log into your Google account, then visit [this link](https://colab.research.google.com). Click on "NEW PYTHON 3 NOTEBOOK" in blue at the bottom right. 

Since the current Python version Colab runs on is 3.10.12, and the package MNE for EEG/ERP data analysis does not come pre-installed, make a copy of [this notebook](https://colab.research.google.com/drive/1M2faNCjkbcLnRuhkxoo7a2euuvZAuMhh) to your Google account to configure your Colab environment.
